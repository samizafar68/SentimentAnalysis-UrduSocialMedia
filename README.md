# Project: Development of an Automatic Sentiment Analysis Tool for Urdu Text on Social Media Platforms

## Natural Language Processing

### Overview
This assignment focuses on developing an NLP pipeline for sentiment analysis of Urdu text from social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube. The goal is to classify Urdu social media posts into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. The project involves several phases, including text preprocessing, stemming, lemmatization, feature extraction, n-gram analysis, and building a sentiment classification model.

### Key Challenges
1. **Urdu Text Complexity**: Urdu grammar, morphology, and script present unique challenges for NLP.
2. **Noisy Data from Social Media**: Handling emojis, special characters, URLs, hashtags, and spelling variations.
3. **Short Conversations & Incomplete Sentences**: Extracting meaningful sentiment from short or incomplete text.
4. **Limited Language Resources**: Limited availability of Urdu stopword lists, pre-built models, and other NLP resources.
5. **Urdu Social Media Dataset**: Working with a publicly available dataset of Urdu text from social media platforms.

### Project Breakdown

#### Phase 1: Text Preprocessing for Urdu Text
1. **Stopword Removal**: Develop a custom list of Urdu stopwords and remove them from the dataset.
2. **Punctuation, Emojis, and Hashtags**: Remove unnecessary punctuation, emojis, URLs, and hashtags.
3. **Short Conversations**: Filter out very short posts or those with less than three words.

#### Phase 2: Stemming and Lemmatization for Urdu Text
1. **Stemming**: Implement or utilize a stemming algorithm for Urdu to reduce word variants to their base form.
2. **Lemmatization**: Implement lemmatization for Urdu to return words to their dictionary form.

#### Phase 3: Feature Extraction from Urdu Text
1. **Tokenization**: Implement word tokenization for Urdu text.
2. **Tf-IDF**: Apply the Tf-IDF algorithm to extract relevant terms from the dataset.
3. **Word2Vec**: Train a Word2Vec model on the dataset to capture the relationship between Urdu words.

#### Phase 4: N-grams Analysis
1. **Unigram, Bigram, and Trigram Analysis**: Create unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams from the dataset.

#### Phase 5: Sentiment Classification Model
1. **Model Building**: Build a machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, or Naive Bayes) to classify the sentiment of Urdu posts.

#### Phase 6: Evaluation & Optimization
1. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance on a validation set of Urdu posts.
2. **Challenges in Urdu Sentiment Analysis**: Discuss the challenges faced when performing sentiment analysis in Urdu.

### Tools and Libraries
- **Python programming language**
- **NLTK, spaCy, or Polyglot** for text processing
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning models
- **Gensim** for Word2Vec
- **pandas, matplotlib** for data analysis and visualization

### Dataset
Use a publicly available Urdu social media dataset, such as the one provided by [Urdu Twitter Sentiment Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shumailakhan/urdu-sarcastic-tweets-dataset) on Kaggle or other similar datasets.
